		<h2>Getting Started With CFML & Twilio</h2>
		<p>The CFML library for Twilio was put together with the goal of taking the simple Twilio API and making it even easier for CFML developers to consume.</p>
		<p>
			A few things you will need to do prior to running any of the samples below:
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio" target="_blank">Twilio.com</a> and create your free trial account.  They will provide you with $30 in free calling credits for testing.</li>
				<li>Once you have created your account you will want to locate your AccountSid and AuthToken.  These can be found under "Developer Tools" on the Dashboard page once logging into your Twilio account.</li>
				<li>Edit the TwilioSettings.cfm template that sits along side this index.cfm page in your file sytem using the AccountSid and AuthToken from your Twilio account.</li>
				<li>Run any of the samples below and have fun with the Twilio & CFML!</li>
			</ol>
